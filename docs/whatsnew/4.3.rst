Transformations to AltAz are now much more precise (and faster)
===============================================================

Following advice from M. K. Brewer and comparisons with accurate verification
samples, the implementations for the transformations to AltAz coordinates were
made much more precise (down to the milli-arcsec level).  To help this, the
``CIRS`` frame has gained an observer ``location`` attribute.

Furthermore, by ensuring expensive calculations of the precession-nutation
matrix are only done once, the transformations have been sped up considerably.
