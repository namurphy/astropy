* xxx distinct people have contributed code

.. _whatsnew-4.3-coordinates:

Transformations to AltAz are now much more precise (and faster)
===============================================================

Following advice from M. K. Brewer and comparisons with accurate verification
samples, the implementations for the transformations to AltAz coordinates were
made much more precise (down to the milli-arcsec level).  To help this, the
``CIRS`` frame has gained an observer ``location`` attribute.

Furthermore, by ensuring expensive calculations of the precession-nutation
matrix are only done once, the transformations have been sped up considerably.

.. _whatsnew-4.3-threadsafe:

Improvements in making Astropy thread-safe
==========================================

To help use of Astropy in multi-threaded environments (e.g., with Dask), an
effort has been started to make the basic infrastructure of ``astropy``
thread-safe for operations that do not explicitly change state. In particular,
parsing of units and angles, and initializing leap-second tables should now be
safe even when done simultaneously in multiple threads, as should any use of
the `~astropy.utils.decorators.lazyproperty` decorator (and the ``lazy=True``
version of `~astropy.utils.decorators.classproperty`).
